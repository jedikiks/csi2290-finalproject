This course is designed to extend the student’s knowledge of, and provide additional hands-on experience with, the programming language encountered in CSC 226, in the context of the structured data types provided by that language, and within the larger contexts of abstract data types and more complex problem-solving situations. Techniques for managing file input and output in the current language will also be studied. A number of classical algorithms and data structures for the storage and manipulation of information of various kinds in a computer’s internal memory will be studied. The student will acquire the knowledge that comes from actually implementing a non-trivial abstract data type and the experience that comes from having to make use, as a client programmer, of an abstract type that has already been implemented.
