Data Mining has emerged as one of the most exciting and dynamic fields in computing science. The driving force for data mining is the presence of petabyte-scale online archives that potentially contain valuable bits of information hidden in them Commercial enterprises have been quick to recognize the value of this concept; consequently, within the span*of a few years, the software market itself for data mining is expected to be in excess of $10 billion. Data mining refers to a family of techniques used to detect interesting nuggets of relationships/knowledge in data. While the theoretical underpinnings of the field have been around for quite some time (in the form of pattern recognition, statistics, data analysis and machine learning), the practice and use of these techniques have been largely ad- hoc. With the availability of large databases to store, manage and assimilate data, the new thrust of data mining lies at the intersection of database systems, artificial intelligence and algorithms that efficiently analyze data. The distributed nature of several databases, their size and the high complexity of many techniques present interesting computational challenges.
