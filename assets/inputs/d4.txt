This course consists of a study of general language design and evaluation. The course will include examination of the design issues of various language constructs, design choices for these constructs in various languages, and comparison of design alternatives. Students will program in a variety of programming languages (FORTRAN, Pascal, C, C++, Java, C#, Lisp, and Prolog) to gain a better understanding of the theoretical discussion. In addition, students will get exposure to other languages ranging from Algol-60 to Ada-95.
