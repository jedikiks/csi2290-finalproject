This course will expose the students to research in applied sciences. The objectives of the course will be achieved through various active learning sessions that involve critical review of papers from scholarly journals and conferences. The activities will also include the preparation and presentation of annotated bibliographies, literature reviews, thesis abstracts, and research project outlines. Students are also required to provide feedback to their colleagues. It is hoped that students will refine their own presentation skills through critically reviewing other presentations. In addition to the regular class activities, students must attend and submit written reports for a total of six (three per semester) external seminars.
