Data Mining has emerged as one of the most exciting and dynamic fields in computing
science. The driving force for data mining is the presence of petabyte-scale online
archives that potentially contain valuable bits of information hidden in them
Commercial enterprises have been quick to recognize the value of this concept;
consequently, within the span*of a few years, the software market itself for data
mining is expected to be in excess of $10 billion. Data mining refers to a family
of techniques used to detect interesting nuggets of relationships/knowledge in
data. While the theoretical underpinnings of the field have been around for quite
some time (in the form of patfern recognition, statistics, data analysis and
machine learning), the practice and use of these techniques have been largely ad-
hoc. With the availability of large databases to store, manage and assimilate data,
the new thrust of data mining lies at the intersection of database systems,
artificial intelligence and algorithms that efficiently analyze data. The
distributed nature of several databases, their size and the high complexity of many
techniques present interesting computational challenges.
