This course will expose the students to research in applied sciences. The
objectives of the course will be achieved through various active learning sessions
that involve critical review of papers from scholarly journals and conferences. The
activities will also include the preparation and presentation of annotated
bibliographies, literature reviews, thesis abstracts, and research project

outlines. Students are also required to provide feedback to their colleagues. It is
hoped that students will refine their own presentation skills through critically
reviewing other presentations. In addition to the regular class activities,
students must attend and submit written reports for a total of six (three per
semester) external seminars.
